# Lead Rush

**Lead Rush** is a research-focused first-person shooter (FPS) game, purpose-built for experimental studies on framerate, latency spikes, and gameplay interruptions. It runs at ultra-high framerates (up to 1500 Hz) and features detailed, timestamped logging of player and game events. The game is designed to support controlled experiments, allowing easy setup of rounds and conditions via configuration files.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Objective:** Eliminate as many enemies as possible before being eliminated. Each enemy takes five shots to kill.
- **Enemies:** One enemy is active at a time, charging at the player from preset spawn points.
- **Player Elimination:** Contact with an enemy results in death and instant respawn (enemies reset).
- **Feedback:** Visual (flashing yellow bars for enemy direction/proximity) and auditory (distinct hit/kill sounds) cues enhance awareness.
- **Rounds:** Each session consists of multiple rounds, each with distinct framerate and/or spike settings.
- **Playability:** After every round, players rate the round for Quality of Experience (QoE).

## Configuration Files

All configuration files are located in `Data/Configs/`. They control the overall experiment setup, per-round conditions, and session tracking.

### 1. `GlobalConfig.csv`

Sets parameters that are fixed for the entire session.

| Column                   | Type    | Units/Values        | Description                               |
|--------------------------|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| roundDuration            | float   | seconds             | Length of each round                      |
| isFTStudy                | bool    | TRUE/FALSE          | Fixed-timing study                        |
| aimSpikeDelay            | float   | ms                  | Delay for aim spikes                      |
| mouseSpikeDelay          | float   | ms                  | Delay for mouse spikes                    |
| mouseSpikeDegreeOfMovement| float  | degrees             | Mouse spike movement threshold            |
| enemySpeedGlobal         | float   | Unity units/second  | Enemy movement speed                      |
| enemyHealthGlobal        | float   | (unitless)          | Enemy health value                        |
| reticleSizeMultiplier    | float   | (multiplier)        | Reticle scaling                           |
| onHitScore               | int     | points              | Points for a hit                          |
| onMissScore              | int     | points              | Points for a miss                         |
| onKillScore              | int     | points              | Points for a kill                         |
| onDeathScore             | int     | points              | Points for a death                        |

### 2. `SessionID.csv`

- **Type:** Integer  
- **Purpose:** Tracks which row of the round configuration is used for the current session.  
- **Automatically increments after each session.**
- **Example Content:**  

---

### 3. Per-Round Condition: `RoundConfig.csv` + `LatinMap.csv`

#### `RoundConfig.csv`
- Each row: sequence of indices (int), one row per session (Latin square).
- Each value points to a row in `LatinMap.csv`.

#### `LatinMap.csv`
Defines each unique round condition.

| Column                      | Type    | Units/Values        | Description                               |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| roundFPS                    | float   | Hz                  | Target framerate                          |
| spikeMagnitude              | float   | ms                  | Simulated spike magnitude                 |
| onAimSpikeEnabled           | bool    | TRUE/FALSE          | Spike when aiming                         |
| onReloadSpikeEnabled        | bool    | TRUE/FALSE          | Spike on reload                           |
| onMouseSpikeEnabled         | bool    | TRUE/FALSE          | Spike on fast mouse movement              |
| onEnemySpawnSpikeEnabled    | bool    | TRUE/FALSE          | Spike on enemy spawn                      |
| attributeScalingEnabled     | bool    | TRUE/FALSE          | Enable attribute scaling                  |

**How It Works:**  
- The current session ID (from `SessionID.csv`) selects a row in `RoundConfig.csv`.
- Each value in that row is used as an index to `LatinMap.csv`, which contains the full per-round settings.
- This ensures each participant gets a counterbalanced sequence of experimental conditions.
